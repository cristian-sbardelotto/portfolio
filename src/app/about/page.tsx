          <p>
            Since I embarked on my journey into the world of{' '}
            <span>web programming</span> in August 2022, I have been captivated
            by its endless possibilities. With each passing day, my{' '}
            <span>passion</span> for this field grows stronger, and I feel more
            inspired than ever.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I work at <span>HashÂ³</span> using the latest
            technologies in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem (more
            details in the experience section below). At the same time, I've
            also been diving into backend development as well, exploring{' '}
            <span>Python and Go</span> to round out my skill set.
          </p>

          <div>
            And what about my <span>soft skills</span>? There we go:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Commitment</span>: I'm punctual and rarely fail with
                deadlines.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>Responsibility</span>: I admit my mistakes and take on the
                duties I can handle.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>Proactivity</span>: I'm the first one to try to get the
                solution and contribute when possible.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>Self Improvement</span>: I'm always finding new ways and
                ideas to boost my knowledge and experience.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            I'm an avid gamer, and have a passion for almost all types of music.
